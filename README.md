# Merkle_Tree
Merkle Tree is a C-based implementation of the Merkle tree (hash tree). It takes a directory and hashes every file within it, and iteratively combines the hashes until a single hash value, known as the Merkle Root, remains. 
The hashing process is performed in alphabetical order based on the file names.
